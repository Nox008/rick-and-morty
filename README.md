Rick and Morty Character Browser üß™

A modern, responsive character browser built with Next.js and the Rick and Morty API. This application allows users to explore characters from the show, with features like pagination, debounced search, and filtering by status or species. The global state is managed efficiently using Redux Toolkit.

Character Grid View: Displays characters with their image, name, status, species, and origin.

Responsive Design: A fluid layout that presents characters as cards on mobile and a grid on larger screens.

Pagination: Easily navigate through the character pages using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.

Debounced Search: Instantly search for characters by name with a debounced input to optimize API requests.

Filtering: Refine your search by character status (Alive, Dead, Unknown) and species (Human, Alien, Robot, etc.).

Redux State Management: Centralized state management for filters, character data, and pagination using Redux Toolkit.
